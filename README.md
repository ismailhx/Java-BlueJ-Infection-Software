# Java-BlueJ-Covid-Software

Here I write part of some software that will be used to 
manage laboratory tests for infection.

When an InfectionTest object is created, its state is set to 
false and isPositive must not be called. However, once the setStatus
method has been called, its status is set to true and it is ok to call 
isPositive to find out whether the result was positive or negative.
